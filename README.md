# CCIP Example - Message With USDC 

This is a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) project bootstrapped with [`create-wagmi`](https://github.com/wevm/wagmi/tree/main/packages/create-wagmi).

**NOTE:** You've to deploy the **CCIPMessageWithUSDC** contract on multiple networks by following the README of this [repository](https://github.com/SyedAsadKazmi/CCIPExample_MessageWithUSDC_HardhatSetup), and then use the contract addresses as **environment variables** given in the `.env.local-sample` file, and create the `.env.local` file by duplicating the same.
